--------------
Pomodoro App
--------------
Must have Python 3 installed.
Do not modify any files.
Double click main.py to run the program.

Hints
--------
You don't have to constantly check the timer - the app window will pop up automatically once the timer is up.
This only works if you DO NOT minimize the timer window (open another tab over the timer instead of minimizing it).

After resetting the timer, you must press "start" to activate it again.

------------------
Future additions
------------------
A sound that plays when the timer is done.
